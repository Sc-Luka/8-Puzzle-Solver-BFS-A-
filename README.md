# 8-Puzzle Solver (BFS & A*)

This is a C++ implementation of the classic 8-puzzle game solver using two popular search algorithms: **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **A\* Search** with **Manhattan distance** as the heuristic.

## 🔍 What is the 8-Puzzle?

The 8-puzzle consists of a 3x3 grid with tiles numbered from 1 to 8 and one empty space (represented by 0). The goal is to slide the tiles into the correct order:

## 🚀 Features

- Solve any solvable 8-puzzle configuration
- Implemented using:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - A* Search (with Manhattan distance heuristic)
- Shows the number of moves and solution path
- Command-line interface (CLI)

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **BFS**: Explores level-by-level and guarantees shortest solution.
- **A\***: Uses heuristic to guide the search and reduce search space.


## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

### Requirements:
- C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later
